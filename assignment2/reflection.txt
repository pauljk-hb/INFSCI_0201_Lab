In object-oriented code, tasks are often already divided into methods within classes. To convert to functional code, these methods must be extracted and converted into independent functions. Class variables that were previously used must be replaced by function inputs in order to avoid dependency on a class structure. After the conversion, the extracted functions must be bundled in a central main function in order to organize the program flow and replace the order previously provided by the class structure.
